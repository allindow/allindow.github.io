Today was the first day of Mod 2. We were asked to fill out the first section of our portfolio where we talk about our learning goals for the mod. I always have trouble with learning goals. How do I know what I want to learn when I don't even know what there IS to learn? It's just this well of information, and I have no idea how deep it goes! I know I want to learn how to build web apps. I want to get better at CSS & HTML. I want to understand Rspec. And I want to know everything else that is going to be presented to me as curated education.

But this well of information...we're drinking from it by the bucket.

This morning, if you asked me to figure out how to recreate a certain website, my eyes would glaze over.

 > Oh... Um... so... there's HTML and CSS here...
 > There are boxes...with margins...I guess
 > There are dividers here and here...but..how do you...
 > Nevermind. I have no idea.

But *now* if you asked me the same thing, I could at least identify key features like the navigation bar, navigation links, buttons, panels **and** maybe even actually get somewhat close to recreate it using <s>magic</s> [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)!

It's amazing what one can learn in a day. This thought has occurred to me often at Turing.
