Alright, so not technically my first blog post ever, but my first written from
an actual text editor using code. One step closer to being "legit"!

As I look forward to all the cool things I'll be learning in Module 2 at
Turing School, I also reflect on the things I learned in Module 1, aside from
a LOT of Ruby. I learned so much about myself in the last 6 weeks - things that
you probably could never learn about yourself if you aren't being challenged
and pushed to your intellectual limits. I learned that if I am stuck on a
problem, if I just walk away for an hour and just *think* about it, I can
usually come up with a solution more quickly than if I had just tried one thing
after another for hours until something worked. I learned that I don't love
the feeling of being challenged, but I do love solving problems. I suppose that
both of those things are true for me is a little weird. Or maybe not...just like
a physical workout, I could totally dread a mental workout, but when it's over,
I get that "Ahhhh, so good!" feeling of accomplishment.

I'm having a hard time articulating just how much I have grown and how much I
learned in Module 1, but the first draft is always the toughest. Dear future
self, you're welcome, and write a better post next time.
